## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to build and evaluate a Random Forest classifier using the Glass dataset. The analysis also includes comparing Bagging and Boosting ensemble methods to improve classification performance.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Glass dataset. It contains various features that describe the properties of glass samples.

## Steps in Analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed the structure and distribution of the dataset.
- Checked for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

### Data Visualization
- Created histograms, box plots, and pair plots to understand feature distributions and relationships.
- Analyzed correlations between features.

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Handling Missing Values**  
   Implemented strategies like imputation or removal based on the nature of missing data.
2. **Encoding Categorical Variables**  
   Applied one-hot encoding to convert categorical data into numerical format.
3. **Feature Scaling**  
   Standardized or normalized data to ensure features are on a similar scale.
4. **Handling Imbalanced Data**  
   Addressed imbalances using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or synthetic data generation (e.g., SMOTE).

### Model Implementation
1. **Train-Test Split**  
   Divided the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. **Random Forest Classifier**  
   Trained a Random Forest model using scikit-learn and evaluated performance with metrics like:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-Score

### Bagging and Boosting Methods
- Applied Bagging (e.g., using Random Forest) and Boosting (e.g., using AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting).
- Compared the performance of these methods with the Random Forest model.
